package controller

// StopChan specifies a standard interface for killing worker threads within controllers.
type StopChan chan uint8

// ControllerInterface represents a controller that manages the state for
// components within the control plane. Controllers watch for updates to
// the state from the API, and work to both set the current state to correlate
// with the desired state. Controllers are not responsible for interfacing with
// the persistence controller to persist the desired state of the controlplane,
// with the notable exception of the storage controller, which directly
// interfaces with and manages backends.
//
// Otherwise, controllers are supposed to create a number of worker threads
// (the number to be determined by the user/main control loop), which then listen
// on channels for incoming events from the API, and then act accordingly with an
// incoming event. They interface with methods such as the node grpc server/
// cri grpc server in order to create the desired state on the host.
type ControllerInterface interface {
	// Begin workers starts up a number of threads for each controller in order
	// to start listening for incoming requests.
