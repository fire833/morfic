/*
	Persistence provider is an interface for storage backends to persist data
	about the control plane to a durable medium for persistence across restarts
	of both the service and the bare metal as a whole. Any persistence provider
	must be able to fulfill the methods described in this interface, otherwise
	the control plane will reject the provider and not be able to communicate/use
	the interface.

	Data written/retrieved from this provider should be considered generally not very
	sensitive, but should still be protected from being exposed to the public/
	over the network. Thus, this interface will be used for storing general
	configuration data/metadata, rather than managing secrets such as API keys
	and credentials. Storage of sensitive information such as the ones perviously
	described will be set to be managed by the SecretPersistenceProviders that are
	registered/configured with the control plane.

		include:

		* Opening/reading file that was persisted and parsing into memory for immediate
		  consumption by the control plane.
		* Creating a client connection to the remote endpoint that will pull the data
		  (ie starting an s3.S3 connection locally, etc.).

		Another example could be you want to persist to both a file locally mounted
		on the bare metal machine, and in another location of the filesystem that is
		actually mounted via NFS onto the bare metal host.

		It is generally up to the discretion of the provider to determine how
		individual instances are to be labeled, but names should be unique and avoid
		any chances for collision between two or more instances at runtime. Given that
		these strings are only to be parsed by persistence management layers rather than
		human administrators, so they do not have to be human readable. The suggested format
		is to repesent an instance as <generic_instance_name>-<instance_hash>.
		To copy the s3 instance noted above, generic_instance_name could be s3, and the
		instance_hash be a uniquely generated hex hash from the configuration of that
